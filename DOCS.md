### Instructions for use

There are 7 tabs in the GUI - 3 support changes, 4 are read only. 
To update the files for a tab, you need to change the 'file location' field and click on the select location button. 
Each tab has several sub-tabs, each displaying a different group/organization. 
The contents of the tabs being changed can be changed and, after pressing the 'Save' button, the changes will be written to the file.
When you change in the files, you need to press the 'Import' button to update the contents of the page.
